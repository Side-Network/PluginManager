To Add this as a dependency add this to your project:
### Gradle
````` groovy
repositories {
    maven { url "https://maven.lenni0451.net/releases" }
}

dependencies {
    implementation("net.lenni0451:SpigotPluginManager:2.7.2") // Update version
}
`````

### Maven
`````xml
<repository>
    <id>lenni0451-maven-releases</id>
    <name>Lenni0451 Maven Repository</name>
    <url>https://maven.lenni0451.net/releases</url>
</repository>

<dependency>
    <groupId>net.lenni0451</groupId>
    <artifactId>SpigotPluginManager</artifactId>
    <version>2.7.2</version>
</dependency>

`````

## Building
First of all make sure you set ``updatable`` to ``false`` in the ``gradle.properties`` file if it is not already. This will prevent SpigotPluginManager from updating itself on startup.\
To build SpigotPluginManager yourself you just need to run ``gradlew build`` in the project root.\
You can find the compiled jar in the ``build/libs/`` folder.
